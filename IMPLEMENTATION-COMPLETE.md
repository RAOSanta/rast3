# ✅ TASK COMPLETED: Admin Moderation System Implementation

## 🎯 Task Summary
**OBJECTIVE**: Add inline admin features for moderating/hiding or deleting kudos posts with proper scope permissions and fix critical security issue where domain/department admins could see hidden posts from outside their scope.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Database Schema Updates** ✅
- Added moderation fields to Kudos table:
  - `hidden BOOLEAN DEFAULT false`
  - `moderatedBy STRING` (references User.id)
  - `moderatedAt DATETIME`
- Applied via `npx prisma db push`

### 2. **Backend API Enhancements** ✅
- **Admin Permission System**: Created `checkAdminPermissions` utility
- **Admin Endpoints**: Added `adminHideKudos` and `adminDeleteKudos` mutations
- **File Cleanup**: Integrated E2 storage file deletion on kudos deletion
- **🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY FIX**: Implemented scope-based hidden post filtering

### 3. **Frontend Admin Components** ✅
- **AdminActionsDropdown**: Complete moderation interface with:
  - Hide/Unhide toggle functionality
  - Delete with confirmation dialog
  - Proper permission checks
  - Immediate cache invalidation
- **Integration**: Added admin controls to KudosFeed component
- **UI Indicators**: Hidden posts show 🔒 label and moderation info

### 4. **Security Implementation** ✅
- **Scope-Based Filtering**: Fixed critical security vulnerability
- **Admin Level Restrictions**:
  - SITE admins: See all posts including all hidden posts
  - DOMAIN admins: See all public posts + hidden posts only from their domain
  - DEPARTMENT admins: See all public posts + hidden posts only from their department
  - Regular users: See only public posts (no hidden posts)

## 🔒 Security Fix Verification

### Before Fix (VULNERABLE):
- Domain/department admins could see hidden posts from outside their scope
- Hidden posts visibility wasn't properly restricted by admin scope

### After Fix (SECURE) - **TESTED & VERIFIED**:
```
📊 Test Results from test-scope-security.ts:
• Site Admin (15 posts): All posts including ALL hidden posts ✅
• Domain Admin (12 posts): Public + hidden from company.com ONLY ✅  
• Department Admin (11 posts): Public + hidden from Engineering ONLY ✅
• Regular User (10 posts): Public posts only, NO hidden posts ✅
```

**🎯 Critical Security Issue RESOLVED**: Domain/department admins can no longer see hidden posts outside their scope.
