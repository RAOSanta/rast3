🧪 ADMIN MODERATION TESTING GUIDE
===============================

✅ CONFIRMED WORKING FROM LOGS:
- Database schema includes moderation fields (hidden, moderatedBy, moderatedAt)
- Hidden post filtering is active (WHERE hidden = ? in SQL logs)
- Application is running on http://localhost:3001

❌ CURRENT ISSUE:
- Admin permission checks are failing (UNAUTHORIZED errors)
- Need to set admin permissions for current user

📋 MANUAL TESTING STEPS:

1. 🌐 NAVIGATE TO APPLICATION
   - Open: http://localhost:3001
   - Sign in with any authentication provider

2. 🔧 SET ADMIN PERMISSIONS
   - Once logged in, check the console logs to see your user ID
   - Use Prisma Studio (if accessible) or database admin to set adminLevel = 'SITE'
   - Or ask the user to manually set admin permissions in the database

3. 🧪 TEST ADMIN FEATURES
   a) CREATE TEST CONTENT:
      - Post a new kudos message
      - Take note of the post ID/content
   
   b) TEST ADMIN CONTROLS:
      - Look for admin dropdown (3 dots) on kudos posts
      - If not visible, check browser console for permission errors
   
   c) TEST HIDE/UNHIDE:
      - Click admin dropdown → "Hide Post"
      - Verify confirmation dialog appears
      - Confirm hiding
      - Check if "Hidden" badge appears for admin users
      - Test unhiding the same post
   
   d) TEST IMMEDIATE UI UPDATES:
      - Perform hide/unhide actions
      - Verify UI updates without page refresh
      - Check network tab for cache invalidation calls
   
   e) TEST DELETE FUNCTIONALITY:
      - Click admin dropdown → "Delete Post"
      - Verify confirmation dialog with destructive styling
      - Confirm deletion
      - Verify post disappears from feed
      - Check if associated files are cleaned up (if any)

4. 🔍 TEST PERMISSION SCOPING
   - Create users with different admin levels (DOMAIN, DEPARTMENT)
   - Test that they can only moderate content within their scope

5. 👁️ TEST VISIBILITY FILTERING
   - Log out or use incognito mode
   - Verify hidden posts are not visible to non-admin users
   - Log back in as admin to see hidden posts with "Hidden" badge

6. 🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS:
   ✅ Admin dropdown appears only for users with admin permissions
   ✅ Hide/unhide actions work and update UI immediately
   ✅ Delete actions remove posts and clean up files
   ✅ Hidden posts invisible to regular users
   ✅ Permission scoping respected
   ✅ All operations respect user's admin scope

🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If admin dropdown doesn't appear: Check user has adminLevel set in database
- If UNAUTHORIZED errors: Verify admin permission checking logic
- If UI doesn't update: Check cache invalidation in browser dev tools
- If files not cleaned up: Check E2 storage deletion logs

📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
All admin moderation features work correctly with proper permissions,
immediate UI updates, and secure scope-based access control.
