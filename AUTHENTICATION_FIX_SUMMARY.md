# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The homepage was making unnecessary tRPC API calls (`profile.getCurrentProfile`) for unauthenticated users, causing excessive errors and poor performance.

## Root Cause
Both `AuthShowcase` and `WishlistManager` components were initializing tRPC queries with `{ enabled: !!sessionData?.user }` condition, but the query hooks were still being called and initialized even for unauthenticated users.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. WishlistManager Component (`src/app/_components/wishlist-manager.tsx`)
- **Added early return**: Added `if (!sessionData?.user) { return null; }` at the top of the component
- **Removed enabled condition**: Since the component now only runs for authenticated users, removed the `{ enabled: !!sessionData?.user }` from the `getCurrentProfile` query
- **Simplified logic**: Simplified `shouldShowWishlist` to only check `userProfile?.profileCompleted`

### 2. AuthShowcase Component (`src/app/_components/auth-showcase.tsx`)
- **Maintained query with enabled condition**: Kept the `{ enabled: !!sessionData?.user }` condition for the `getCurrentProfile` query since this component needs to handle both authenticated and unauthenticated states
- **Moved early return after hooks**: Moved the conditional rendering logic after all hooks to avoid violating the rules of hooks
- **Separated concerns**: Unauthenticated users see only the sign-in button and modal, authenticated users see the full profile interface

## Key Differences in Approach

### WishlistManager
- **Complete early return**: Component doesn't render anything for unauthenticated users
- **No tRPC queries initialized**: Zero API calls made for unauthenticated users

### AuthShowcase  
- **Conditional query execution**: Query is initialized but disabled for unauthenticated users
- **Different UI rendering**: Shows different UI based on authentication state
- **Maintains hook order**: All hooks called in consistent order to follow React rules

## Benefits
1. **Zero unnecessary API calls**: Unauthenticated users no longer trigger profile-related tRPC calls
2. **Better performance**: Reduced server load and faster page loads for unauthenticated users
3. **Cleaner error logs**: No more authentication errors from profile queries
4. **Better UX**: Clear separation between authenticated and unauthenticated user experience

## Files Modified
- `src/app/_components/wishlist-manager.tsx`
- `src/app/_components/auth-showcase.tsx`

## Testing
- Homepage loads without tRPC errors for unauthenticated users
- Sign-in functionality works correctly
- Authenticated users still receive proper profile data
- Component rendering is appropriate for each user state
